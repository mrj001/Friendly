Investigation of Friendly Numbers

Inspired by this [Numberphile video](https://www.numberphile.com/videos/a-video-about-the-number-10).

In choosing the parameters of the polynomials, it is recommended that a be approximately sqrt(kN/2) / M.
When d = sqrt(a) is not in the factor base, a turns out to be about 2 orders of magnitude larger than this approximate value.  This does not work well - insufficient B-Smooth numbers are found.
